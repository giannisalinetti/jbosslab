# JBoss Lab

A small collection of sources and wars for JBoss EAP 6.x testing purposes.
All these sorces are borrowed from the JBoss Quickstarts collection.
The pom.xml of every project was updated to fix a build issue with Maven (jboss-javaee-6.0 version not resolved).

- helloworld: A simple Hello World app
- temperature-converter: a temperature conversion app (F2C/C2F).
- ejb-time: this app uses an ejb to send messages to the application server console log handler
- greeter: a simple app to say hello to users
